### 2026-02-27: Added @copilot as Coding Agent
**By:** Marc (via Squad Coordinator)
**What:** Added GitHub Copilot coding agent (@copilot) to the team roster with auto-assign enabled. Capability profile added to team.md with 🟢/🟡/🔴 fit ratings. Instructions installed at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Routing updated so Carlos triages issues against the capability profile before assigning `squad:copilot` labels.
**Why:** User requested autonomous issue pickup for suitable tasks. Enables @copilot to pick up 🟢-rated issues (tests, single-file implementations, docs, README updates) without human intervention.
